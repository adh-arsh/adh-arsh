# Hi, I'm Adharsh 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a **tech enthusiast** with experience across software development, automation, systems engineering, AI/ML, and infrastructure. I work closely with systems—building, debugging, automating, and optimizing applications that span from low-level infrastructure to intelligent software solutions.

I enjoy solving complex technical problems, experimenting with emerging technologies, and building systems that work reliably in real-world conditions.
